This project demonstrates how financial data can be transformed into actionable business insights using SQL for analysis and Excel for reporting and visualisation.

The goal was to simulate a real-world finance scenario where a business needs to track:
Monthly revenue performance
Budget vs actual results
Variance trends
Operating profitability


Tools Used:
SQL (SQLite) — data modelling, joins, KPI calculations
Excel — dashboard creation and visualisation
CSV exports — data pipeline between SQL and reporting layer

Key Business Questions Answered:

How is monthly revenue performing vs budget?
Which months are underperforming financially?
What is the variance percentage between actual and expected revenue?
What is the company’s operating profit trend?
